# Financial Time Series Forecasting based on SVM and other ML techniques

## Abstract

This project aims to predict the stock price of financial time series using two Machine Learning techniques: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebook, a web-based interactive development environment that allows combining live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. This project has discussed about background reading of different Machine Learning techniques on financial time series forecasting and the stages of designing, processing and analyzing financial time series data using the two Machine Learning algorithms in the final report. This is a technical documentation that describes the project source codes, the dataset chosen, the background of the two ML algorithms and the performance metric used to measure the effectiveness of the models.

## Getting Strated

To run the code in this project, Jupyter Notebook has to be installed on local machine. the following Python libraries also have to be installed:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* SciPy
* Scikit-learn
* Statsmodels
* Keras
* TensorFlow

Install the libraries using the command:

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn statmodels keras tensorflow
    
There is and additional file called utilities.py which consists a set of functions that need to be imported into the notebook.

After installing the required libraries, clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebook file *'Project (without outlier).ipynb'* and *'Project (with outlier).ipynb'* to see the implementation details.
